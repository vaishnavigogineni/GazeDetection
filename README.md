Gaze Tracking and Crowd Analysis with Face Recognition
Introduction
Welcome to the Gaze Tracking and Crowd Analysis project! This repository contains code for a Python application that analyzes video streams to track gaze behavior, detect faces, and perform crowd analysis using advanced face recognition techniques.

Project Overview
The Gaze Tracking and Crowd Analysis project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into human interaction with visual content. By leveraging cutting-edge face recognition algorithms and computer vision techniques, the application offers a wide range of functionalities, including:

Gaze Tracking: Precisely tracks the movement of a person's gaze within a video stream, enabling analysis of visual attention patterns and direction of focus.
Facial Recognition: Detects and recognizes faces within the video feed, extracting facial landmarks and performing gaze analysis to understand human behavior.
Crowd Analysis: Counts the number of distinct faces present in each frame of the video, facilitating crowd enumeration and demographic analysis.
Libraries Used
OpenCV: Used for image processing tasks, including face detection, landmark extraction, and frame manipulation.
dlib: Utilized for its facial recognition capabilities, including face detection and landmark prediction.
NumPy: Employed for efficient array manipulation and mathematical operations.
Math: Used for mathematical computations, such as calculating distances and ratios.
